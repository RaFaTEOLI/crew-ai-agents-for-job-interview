I prioritize data requests by assessing business impact, urgency, and alignment with key objectives. I communicate with stakeholders to clarify scope and expected outcomes, then use a tracking system (like Jira or Trello) to manage deadlines and dependencies. When priorities conflict, I discuss trade-offs with stakeholders and managers to ensure transparency. I also document recurring requests to automate or streamline future work, ensuring efficiency and consistency.
