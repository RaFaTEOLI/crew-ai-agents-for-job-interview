# Crew AI Agents for Job Interview

Playing around with CrewAI and OpenAI to AI Agents to help in a fictional job interview scenario.

## Project Structure

This project contains two main Jupyter notebooks:

### job-interview-prep-1/main.ipynb

This notebook implements an interactive interview preparation system with two AI agents:

- An Interviewer Agent that takes on the role of the actual interviewer, using their background and job details to ask relevant questions
- A Coach Agent that provides immediate feedback on the user's answers, highlighting strengths, areas for improvement, and tips for better responses

### job-interview-prep-2/main.ipynb

The second notebook builds upon the first one's functionality by:

- Storing interview questions and feedback in the outputs directory
- Generating detailed interview preparation reports
- Maintaining records of different interview scenarios (e.g., Beat81, Data Analytics positions)
