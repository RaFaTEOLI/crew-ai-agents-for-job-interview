In a recent project, I combined SQL and Python to analyze customer churn. Using SQL, I extracted and joined data from multiple tables to calculate key metrics like purchase frequency and support interactions. Then, in Python, I cleaned and analyzed the data with pandas and built a logistic regression model using scikit-learn to identify churn predictors. Visualizations with seaborn highlighted trends that informed targeted retention strategies. As a result, the company reduced churn by 15% in the following quarter. This project showcased how SQL and Python together can turn data into actionable business insights.

I prioritize multiple analytics requests by first understanding each stakeholderâ€™s goals, urgency, and business impact. I categorize requests based on priorityâ€”focusing on those that drive key decisions or have tight deadlines. I maintain a clear request tracker to monitor progress and communicate timelines transparently. For overlapping needs, I look for opportunities to create reusable analyses or dashboards. Regular check-ins help manage expectations and ensure alignment. This structured yet flexible approach allows me to deliver timely, high-quality insights while keeping stakeholders informed and satisfied.
